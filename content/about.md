Myself "Shiras Hassan", a full stack developer and Domain-Driven-Design Enthusiast.

Its been a while i was thinking to write a blog. 
Today i am happy to open one tech blog.
I hope this will help me to connect with more members and share my thoughts on various subjects.
And ultimately i want to document all my learnings under this blog.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to ask.

Thanks for reading!
